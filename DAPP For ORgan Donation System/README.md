# DAPP For Organ Donation System

The proposed system digitalizes the process of Organ Donation, enhances the existing system by
handling endless data and provides a transparent as well as cost efficient system.

## About the Source code

### Tech Stacks used:

Solana, ReactJS, Figma, WEB3.js, API, Phantom, QuickNode, CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap

### About the project:
The proposed Systemis faster, more secure and more scalable. The organ receiver and donor can be sure of the authenticity
of the other without hesitation. The Organ Donation System does not allow any third-party access. 
The system eliminates the corruption in department of organ donation through a transparent system and the
patients will be able to get the organ before it is too late.



## Motivation

Motivation : Over 30,00000 organ transplants are performed on average every year in the World. Minutes count after organs are removed from a donor and how much time is available before it must be transplanted to recipient (Heart/lungs &lt;4-6 hr, Liver &lt;8-10 hr, Pancreas &lt;15 hr). Finding ways to improve the speed of organ deliveries while improving security and reducing errors can lead to saving more human lives. Our solution was to create a dApp called ORgan Donation System.
